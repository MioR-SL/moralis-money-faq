## ðŸ˜Ž How is Moralis Money different from other "On-Chain Analytics" websites and services? 
1. Moralis Money is different from other on-chain analytics platforms because we give simple tools that unlock true alpha. The information we provide is easy to apply in the markets and integrate into your daily trading. **Other platforms that try to compete with us often waste your time with endless charts and other non-actionable on-chain data.**
2. Moralis Money is made by people who have a good track record trading altcoins (for example Ivan on Tech was one of the first people to get into MATIC at just a few cents). **Other platforms that try to compete with us often are made by data-scientists without trading experience. Their tools don't help you become successful in crypto, they just provide information overload.**
