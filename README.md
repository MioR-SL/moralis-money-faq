# 👋 Welcome to Moralis Money FAQ!

Here you will find all the answers to the most common questions about https://moralismoney.com

# How do filters work?

## 🕚 Coin Age

Measures the time since the coin was minted.

## 💸 Buyers

Measures how many new addresses bought the coin during the specified time-frame.

Any address who has zero coins and uses a DEX to buy some coins during the specified time-frame is counted as a buyer.

## 💸👴 Experienced Buyers

Same as Buyers with the additional requirement that the address needs to have at least 100 outgoing transactions to be qualified.

(we are working on adding additional requirements such as the age of the address)

## 💦 Liquidity

Measures how much liquidity changed during the specified time-frame.

## 💎 Holders

Measures how much holders changed during the specified time-frame.

# 📈 Why will Moralis Money 10x in value over the coming months?

1. **Altcoin season coming** - first and foremost, Moralis Money will automatically become more valuable as the bull market returns and altcoins start flying. The tools we provide will become even more invaluable when the potential returns are 10-100x higher in an altcoin season in comparison to today. 
2. **Price increases coming** - As the bull market is coming back we will increase our prices. We want the paid features to be exclusive. They are extremely valuable. We have already announced a [50% increase in price when Bitcoin reaches $30,000 - from $97 to $147 per month](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/moralis-money-faq/blob/main/price-increase-30k-bitcoin.md).f you buy the pro plan today we will honor the current price for you as long as you stay subscribed. Therefore it is very important that you subscribe right now if you are serious about this bull market and like our product.
3. **Alerts Coming** - We will soon launch Token Alerts - meaning that you can save a query and receive emails whenever new coins fit the criteria in that query. Imagine you have a query such as `Give me all coins on Polygon that were minted today which have been bought by at least 1000 whales` - you will see very few coins qualifying for such criteria. But you know that if a coin ever meets this criteria - you want to buy it asap. Using our alerts you will be notified about such coins in real time.
4. **Extensive Security Coming** - In the coming months we plan to 10x the amount of information we give about the security of each coin in order to ensure that you have as much info as possible to avoid scams and rug pulls.
5. **10x More Filters** - We are already working hard on new filters, such as `Profitable Whales`, `Profitable Meme Coin Investors` and many many other. The current filters are just a small teaser of what's about to come.
6. Token Dashboard - search any token and see all info about the token

**In summary - we are just at the very early stages of our product and we are so excited to all the early adopters that are becoming paid subscribers. We will honor the low prices we offer today if you stay subscribed. We can't wait to share these bull market times with you 🤩📈**


# ⚡️ How fast is new data ingested?

Moralis Money offers different time frames for each filter.

<img width="1001" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-09 at 13 54 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11097108/224029126-54385ed1-8ed8-4964-bf4c-9294000f9006.png">

The lowest time-frame we currently support dictates refresh rate for all time-frames.

Each interval of the lowest time frame we recalculate all other time frames and roll up the data.

We plan to support even lower time frames in the future.

4. More logo support


# Optimism FAQ

## Why are there few coins on Optimism?

There are 2 reasons:

1) We only support Uniswap currently, we are integrating Velodrome which will add more coins
2) Even when Velodrome is added the number of projects on Optimism will be low compared to other chains as Optimism doesnt have a lot of activity as it is still a new chain.

According to DEXScreener:
1. Optimism has 508 pairs
2. Arbitrum has 1750 pairs
3. Ethereum has 5000 pairs
